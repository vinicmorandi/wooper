## About Wooper (WIP)

Wooper is a Pok√©mon Battle Simulator made using ReactJS, NodeJS, GraphQL and SocketIO. 

## How to start the project

Create a MySQL database called `pokemon`

Run the following commands in your Command Prompt:

`npm run dev`

`npm start`

After that, you *should* be good to go. If something's not working, just hmu and I'll help you get it started.
